# --description--

The pronoun `it` is used to replace a noun that has already been mentioned to avoid repetition.

In this sentence, you can identify that `it` refers to `Visual Studio Code` because Tom is talking about the program and its features. 

Since `Visual Studio Code` is the tool that should support the feature, `it` naturally replaces the program's name.
