<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: The live preview isn't showing in Visual Studio Code. -->

# --description--

The Present Continuous tense is used to describe actions that are happening right now. When you want to say that something is **not** happening, you use the negative form. For example: 

In the sentence `The live preview isn't showing`, Tom is expressing that the live preview is currently not visible in `Visual Studio Code.` 

The word `isn't` is a contraction of `is not`, and it’s used to make the sentence negative.
