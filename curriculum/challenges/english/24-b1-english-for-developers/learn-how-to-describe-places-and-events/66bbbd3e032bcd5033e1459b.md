`Live Preview` is a feature in development tools that lets you see the changes you make to your code immediately as you type.

`Live` means happening in real-time, and `Preview` means seeing how something will look. 

Together, they describe a tool that shows you a live, real-time view of your work as you develop, especially useful in web development.
