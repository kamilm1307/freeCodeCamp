<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: I'm struggling with these IDEs. -->

# --description--

The verb `struggle` means to have difficulty with something. For example:

`The program struggles to load.` - This means the program has difficulty loading.

In the Present Continuous tense, you describe actions that are happening right now. For example:

`The program is struggling to load.` - This means the program is currently having difficulty loading.

Notice that when adding `-ing` to `struggle`, the final `e` is dropped. This is a common rule when forming the Present Continuous tense with verbs that end in `e`.

In Tom's sentence, he is using the Present Continuous tense to describe his ongoing difficulty with IDEs. 

You should add `-ing` to `struggle` because the action is happening right now.
