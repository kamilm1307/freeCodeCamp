# --description--

The Present Continuous tense is used to describe actions that are happening at the moment of speaking. It is formed using the verb `to be` (`am, is, are`) + the base form of the verb + `-ing`.

For example:
`She is currently working on her project.` - This means she is working on her project right now.

`Might` indicates possibility, but the question asks about a decision that has already been made.
