<!-- 
To-do:
- Make test for checking story template flexible -->

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 

**User Stories:**

1. You should declare the following variables using `let`:
   
- `adjective`
- `noun`
- `verb`
- `place`
- `adjective2`
- `noun2`

1. You should assign the above variables some string values of your choice.

2. You should declare a `firstStory` variable using `const` to store the first story.
   
3. You should use the following story template to create the first story and assign it to the `firstStory` variable:

`"Once upon a time, there was a(n) [adjective] [noun] who loved to eat [noun2]. The [noun] lived in a [place] and had [adjective2] nostrils that blew fire when it was [verb]."`;

1. You should output your first story to the console using the message `"First story:\n" + firstStory`.

1. You should assign new values to your `adjective`, `noun`, `verb`, `place`, `adjective2`, and `noun2` variables.

1. Create another story using the same template and assign it to the `secondStory` variable.

1. You should output your second story to the console using the message `"Second story:\n" + secondStory`.


# --hints--

You should declare an `adjective` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(adjective);
```

You should declare a `noun` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(noun);
```

You should declare a `verb` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(verb);
```

You should declare a `place` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(place);
```

You should declare an `adjective2` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(adjective2);
```

You should declare a `noun2` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(noun2);
```

You should assign a string value to the `adjective` variable.

```js
assert.isString(adjective);
```

You should assign a string value to the `noun` variable.

```js
assert.isString(noun);
```

You should assign a string value to the `verb` variable.

```js
assert.isString(verb);
```

You should assign a string value to the `place` variable.

```js
assert.isString(place);
```

You should assign a string value to the `adjective2` variable.

```js
assert.isString(adjective2);
```

You should assign a string value to the `noun2` variable.

```js
assert.isString(noun2);
```

You should declare a `firstStory` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(firstStory);
```

Your story template should use the format `"Once upon a time, there was a(n) [adjective] [noun] who loved to eat [noun2]. The [noun] lived in a [place] and had [adjective2] nostrils that blew fire when it was [verb]."`.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /Once upon a time, there was a\(n\) \${adjective} \${noun} who loved to eat \${noun2}. The \${noun} lived in a \${place} and had \${adjective2} nostrils that blew fire when it was \${verb}/);
// add test for concatenation possibility
```

You should log your first story using the message `"First story:\n" + firstStory`.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /console.log\("First story:\\n" \+ firstStory\)/);
```

You should declare a `secondStory` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(secondStory);
```

Your second story should use the format `"Once upon a time, there was a(n) [adjective] [noun] who loved to eat [noun2]. The [noun] lived in a [place] and had [adjective2] nostrils that blew fire when it was [verb]."`

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /Once upon a time, there was a\(n\) \${adjective} \${noun} who loved to eat \${noun2}. The \${noun} lived in a \${place} and had \${adjective2} nostrils that blew fire when it was \${verb}/);
// add test for concatenation possibility
```

You should reassign the `adjective` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/adjective\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `noun` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/noun\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `verb` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/verb\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `place` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/place\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `adjective2` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/adjective2\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `noun2` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/noun2\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```


You should log your second story using the message `"Second story:\n" + secondStory`.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /console.log\("Second story:\\n" \+ secondStory\)/);
```
