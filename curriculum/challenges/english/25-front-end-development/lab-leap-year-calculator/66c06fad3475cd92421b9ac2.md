# --description--

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 

**User Stories:**

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by `100` and not divisible by `400`. For example, `2000` is a leap year, but 1900 is not. Also, a leap year has an extra day in February, which is the 29th day of the month.

1. Declare a variable `year` that stores the value of the year to check.

2. Use an `if/ else` statement or a ternary operator to check if the year is a leap year. 

3. To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions:
   
- If the year is divisible by `4`, then it is a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by `100`, then it is not a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by `400`, then it is a leap year.

1. If the year is a leap year, output `[year] is a leap year.` to the console. Otherwise, output `[year] is not a leap year.`. You will replace [year] with the year variable.

# --hints--

You should declare a variable `year` and assign it a value to check if it is a leap year.

```js

```

You should first check if the year is divisible by `4`.

```js

```

You should check if the `year` is divisible by `4` and not divisible by `100` to qualify as a leap year.

```js

```

If the year is not divisible by `4`, and is divisible by `100`, you should check if the year is divisible by `400`.

```js

```

If the year is a leap year, you should log `[year] is a leap year.` to the console. Otherwise, log `[year] is not a leap year.` to the console.

```js

```

If the year is not a leap year, log `[year] is not a leap year.` to the console.

```js

```

# --solutions--

```js
const year = 2024;

if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0) {
  console.log(year + " is a leap year.");
} else {
  console.log(year + " is not a leap year.");
}
```
